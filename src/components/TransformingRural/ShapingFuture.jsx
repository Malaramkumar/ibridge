        <h2>🌟 Significance of Skill-Based Learning from School Level from School Level</h2>
        <p>
         Traditional education provides knowledge, but skill-based learning ensures application. By introducing practical, industry-relevant skills at the school stage, students learn to connect theory with practice, which helps them retain knowledge better and apply it creatively. Early exposure to hands-on projects and real-world problem-solving boosts their confidence and instills an entrepreneurial mindset.
